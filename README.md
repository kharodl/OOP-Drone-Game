# OOP-Drone-Game
An object oriented design based arcade game created from scratch by me and a partner as part of a course at SJSU to demonstrate GUI and multithreaded development, completed in Fall 2018. 

The GUI is mostly handled by the DroneGame class, which uses several other object classes to create and manage UI elements. There is also some amount of multithreading and mutex incorporated into the Timer class to make gameplay smoother and prevent it from impacting the performance of other elements.
