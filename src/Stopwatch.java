 * Purpose: to keep track of time for the drone game. Gets displayed at the top of the 
 * screen. Once the time in the stopwatch has reached a certain number, it will signal the game
 * to be over.
 * 
 * From the instructions:  time for the game is 1:30 minutes. If the drone does not hit more than 
 * 2 airplanes during the time, then the game finishes, the userï¿½s score is incremented by one, 
 * and the time is reset.
